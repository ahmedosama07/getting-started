# Getting Involved with OreSat

OreSat is an educational CubeSat project based out of various Oregon educational institutions. So far this includes Portland State University, University of Oregon, and Oregon State University but we're hoping for more participation by other institutions. Although designing, building, and testing CubeSats isn't easy, we hope getting involved is!

## Part One: Read up!

First, learn about CubeSats:

- Read the [Wikipedia page on Cubesats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat). This is a surprisingly good summary of CubeSats.
- CAREFULLY read the [CubeSat Design specification (CDS)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5418c831e4b0fa4ecac1bacd/t/56e9b62337013b6c063a655a/1458157095454/cds_rev13_final2.pdf). As we design OreSat, we'll constantly refer to this design spec so understanding it deeply is a good idea.

Second, you should know about the NASA programs we will use:

- The [NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI)](http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/CubeSats_initiative) is the program we apply for in order to get launched by NASA through the ELaNa initiative.
- The [Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa)](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/elana/index.html) is an initiative of the NASA's Launch Services Program. ELaNa schedules and flies CubeSats that were accespted by CSLI. You don't get to choose how or when you get into space, but eventually, they'll get you there.


Third, you should read our CSLI we submitted in November 2016:
- We were selected in Feb 2017 for a mission sometime in 2019, or 2020!
- This is our [CSLI Application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14tVKG3zUM8z3veoS7e48N7SzJjz4EsHnLw-HVKZd4v0/edit)


Fourth, you should know some things about the space environment:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing
   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_for_use_in_vacuum
- _TODO: more links here on the space environment, specifically thermal and power_

Fifth, learn how we're going to have to test this thing:

- [Launch Service Program ... CubeSat Requirements Document](http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/627972main_LSP-REQ-317_01A.pdf) is how NASA will test the CubeSat (and P-POD CubeSat dispenser) before hucking OreSat into space. Please read this carefully. 
- There are more nitty gritty details in [GSFC-STD-7000](https://standards.nasa.gov/standard/gsfc/gsfc-std-7000). It isn't fun reading, but it tells you a lot about what a launch provider cares about.

## Part Two: Getting Involved!

There are a _lot_ of things to be done for OreSat. They range from the technical (thermal simulations, board layout, RF communications, embedded Linux, firmware, machining, solar power systems, space deployables, radiation hardening, etc) to the day-to-day (fund-raising, project management, etc). 

We meet weekly at PSU - please see the [Portland State Aerospace Society's Google Calendar](http://psas.pdx.edu/join/) for our current meeting times and locations.

Otherwise, contact us at `info@psas.pdx.edu` in order to learn about what's going on and how to get involved!
