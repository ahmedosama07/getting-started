# How to Build a CubeSat

First, learn what the hell a cubesat is!

1. Read the [Wikipedia page on Cubesats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat).
2. CAREFULLYread the [CubeSat Design specification (CDS)](http://www.cubesat.org/images/developers/cds_rev13_final2.pdf).

Now you've got the technical specification and background on cubesats. At this point, it's worth your while to take an hour or so and browse the other documents on the [cubesat developer's site](http://www.cubesat.org/index.php/documents/developers).
