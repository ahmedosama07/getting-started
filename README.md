# Getting Involved with OreSat

**OreSat** is Oregon's first satellite! It's a state-wide educational CubeSat project being run out of Portland State University, along with many of Oregon's other educational institutions including University of Oregon and Oregon State University.

Designing, building, and testing CubeSats isn't easy, but it's OMG we're going to space. So get involved!

## Part One: The Basics!

- Read the [Wikipedia page on Cubesats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat). This is a surprisingly good summary of CubeSats.
- CAREFULLY read the [CubeSat Design specification (CDS)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5418c831e4b0fa4ecac1bacd/t/56e9b62337013b6c063a655a/1458157095454/cds_rev13_final2.pdf). As we design OreSat, we'll constantly refer to this design spec so understanding it deeply is a good idea.
- The [NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI)](http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/CubeSats_initiative) is the program we applied to  for in order to get launched by NASA through the ELaNa initiative.
- The [Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa)](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/elana/index.html) is an initiative of the NASA's Launch Services Program. ELaNa schedules and flies CubeSats that were accespted by CSLI. We haven't been manifested yet, but when we do, it'll be through ELaNa.

## Part Two: OreSat!

First and foremost, you should read the [OreSat 2016 CubeSat Launch Initiative proposal](http://oresat.org/mission/oresat-2016-csli-application-r6-PUBLIC.pdf). This is the proposal that got us into the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative, which is how we're going to get to space in 2019/2020.

## Part Three: Space!

Fourth, you should know some things about the space environment:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing
   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_for_use_in_vacuum
   
- [Bryan Klofas](https://www.klofas.com/papers/) a ground station engineer from [Planet Labs](https://www.planet.com/) wrote two papers discussing communications systems used on CubeSat missions which also touch on mission details and some of the failures experienced.
   - [Missions from the 1999 beginnings to 2008](https://www.klofas.com/papers/CommSurvey-Bryan_Klofas.pdf)
   - [Missions from 2009 to 2012](https://www.klofas.com/papers/Klofas_Communications_Survey_2009-2012.pdf)
- _TODO: more links here on the space environment, specifically thermal and power_

## Part Four: Getting Involved!

There are a _lot_ of things to be done for OreSat. They range from the technical (thermal simulations, board layout, RF communications, embedded Linux, firmware, machining, solar power systems, space deployables, radiation hardening, etc) to the day-to-day (fund-raising, project management, etc). 

- We meet weekly at PSU - please see the [Portland State Aerospace Society's Google Calendar](http://psas.pdx.edu/join/) for our current meeting times and locations.
- All of our designs are open source, and located at <http://github.com/oresat>. Go take a gander and see what's there.
- All of our shared documents that aren't on Github are in Google Drive. They're mostly logistical in nature. Once you start volunteering with us, we'll share that folder with you.

Otherwise, contact us at `info@psas.pdx.edu` in order to learn about what's going on and how to get involved!
